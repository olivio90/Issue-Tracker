I think we should be able to use /T SPAWN to any town spawn in the world!

We have been losing players everyday and it isnt rare to see someone saying the economy is broken. 
I belive it is possible to fix by allowing players to sell their things in their towns.
it would be pretty usefull. And it would also ally people to stay in the same nation bcs people usually leave only because they want their own spawn.
And it wouldnt lag if you have to be an ally to do it (just like it is right now, you have to be an ally to go to a /n spawn)
But i also propose that we should allow people to travel to /N SPAWN without needing to be ally.

also i belive we should allow people to sell more than 1 stack per each chest, but i'll make other issue tracker onlyy for that.

so:


1 - allow people to use /T SPAWN to any town, or, if you think it is a bad idea, 1.1: at least ally nation's towns
2 - allow people to travel to any /N SPAWN even when they are not ally
3 - allow people to sell more than 1 stack per each chest.






let me give you an example:
the nation of France has the towns: PARIS, LYON and BORDEAUX.
the nation of SPAIN has the towns: MADRID, BARCELONA and CORDOBA.
if the point 1 is made, so anyone can travel to those towns. If the point 1 isnt accepted but the point 1.1 is, so:
if france allys with spain, everyone from those nations can teleport to any of those towns and both /n spawns. 

about the point 3:
it is impossible to sell like more than 1 stack of Dirt for 1g right now. I wish we could sell like 10 stacks of dirt for 1g in the same chest.
